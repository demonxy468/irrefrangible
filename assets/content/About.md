<h3>Hi! I'm Oliver</h3>  
<br/>
I'm a [Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) (HCI) researcher and programmer
living [slightly north of Castle Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston). I study online communities, focusing on
how people consume content, how user behaviour varies between desktop and mobile platforms, and how we can best understand systemic bias in peer-production communities. My C.V. can be found [here](/misc/cv.pdf).

A long-time Wikipedia editor, I'm employed by the Wikimedia Foundation as a researcher, geolocating the heck out of everything. Prior to that I worked at the Foundation as the first community manager in our product development team, and prior to *that* I worked as (by decreasing length of survival) a political campaigner, a free culture advocate, a librarian and a butcher.

Outside of research I'm a dedicated C++ and R programmer, and enjoy nothing more than writing whip-fast packages for a variety of tasks (see 'Code') and contrasting that with writing things you should definitely not write in R, in R. [Like this website](https://github.com/Ironholds/irrefrangible).

I'm powered by [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8532388-oliver), archery and [that Midwest hippity-hoppity nonsense the kids love so much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Cities_hip_hop).
